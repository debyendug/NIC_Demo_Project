Here you can see the CURD operation.
In my project, I used POST and PUT methods to create APIs.
Download Visual Studio Download my Code and run it on your machine.
You need to change the Database Connection and I am providing a Database Table script on a Text file, just copy and paste in your SQL server Queary section and execute it.
Then run my API, and you will get a result.
